## Introduction

Delhi is often ranked among the most polluted cities globally.
This project analyzes PM2.5 and PM10 data to uncover seasonal trends,
correlation between pollutants, and high-risk periods for air quality.

## Dataset
**Source:** [Delhi Air Quality Data | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kunshbhatia/delhi-air-quality-dataset/)  

## Skills and Tools used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** - handled missing values, removed duplicates, fixed data types  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - distribution plots, seasonal trends, correlation matrix  
3. **Insights** - identified strong PM2.5-PM10 correlation, seasonal pollution spikes  
4. **Conclusion** - recommendations for targeted pollution control


## Results & Insights
- PM2.5 and PM10 show a strong positive correlation (0.72)  
- Pollution levels are highest in winter months (Nov-Jan)  
- Lowest levels recorded during monsoon season (Jul-Aug)  
- Certain days show extreme spikes (likely due to Diwali fireworks or dust storms)
